# Easy Bomb Defuser (for [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](https://keeptalkinggame.com/))

This project aims at creating a **tool app** to help a solver giving instructions.
I would like to create it with react, but, since it will take time learning it, I will first develop the code on a notebook and eventually a streamlit app.

This project will be in **french**. It will focus on the french manual and some modules won't work with the english manual because of that.
I might add an english version later (but probably won't)
